****This is a personal project to validate my semester******

This website an e-learning website : 
Teachers can upload their files but they have to authentificate first.
Students can view all the uploaded teacher's files they also have to authentificate first
Guests(those who don't have an account) have restricted access to those files.
It also has a contact form

To visit the website, here is the link : http://165.22.95.83/web/index.php

PS: This is my first website so I basically had to learn everything from scratch.. Thanks to this project I now have good knowledge about PHP JS and HTML5/CSS :)
